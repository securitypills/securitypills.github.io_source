Staying up to date with all the different news occuring in the industry is near impossible. I created this curated list to help you solve that problem. 

The **Security Pills Newsletter** is a hand curated list that brings you the news, latest research, tips, and vulnerabilities focused to the appsec and smart contract landscape.

Once subscribed, you will receive **every Monday** an email with the most significant links. Sometimes I also write [blog posts](/articles) on technical stuff or about anything else of interest to me.


## Some Insights
Before subscribing you can take a look at what you will be receiving, by checking all our [previous issues](../portfolio/).
